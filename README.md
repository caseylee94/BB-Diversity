# BB-Diversity

## Project Overview

"Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel."

The purpose of this weekly assignment is to build a dynamic dashboard where a user interacts to select an anonymous test subject and can then view relevant data for each subject. 

Tasks:
* Build a bar chart displaying the top ten bacterial strains found in that individual's belly button
* Build a bubble chart displaying the number of bacterial cultures per samples
* Build a gauge chart displaying the frequency of washes of the belly button per week
* Add three additional developments to the website
